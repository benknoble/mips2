## MIPS interpreting MIPS

[![This project is considered experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-critical.svg)](https://benknoble.github.io/status/experimental/)

Interprets the relatively complete subset of MIPS built on hardware for UNC Comp
541 in the same subset.

Takes advantage of memory-mapped IO from hardware to play sounds based on the
current instruction and to display the current set of registers.

Design documentation to come.
